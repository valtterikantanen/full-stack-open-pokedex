In this answer, it's assumed that the application is coded in Python.

## Linting
Popular Python tools for code quality and style consistency include Pylint, Flake8, and Black. Pylint checks code quality and style, Flake8 analyzes code using multiple different linters, and Black enforces a consistent style.

## Testing
Python provides a built-in unit testing framework called unittest. pytest is another widely used testing framework with features like test discovery, fixtures, and assertions. It can be integrated with coverage.py to measure code coverage.

## Building
Python projects can be packaged and distributed using setuptools and pip. These tools manage project dependencies, create distribution packages, and handle installations.

## Alternatives for Jenkins and GitHub Actions

The following options could be considered:

- Travis CI: A cloud-based CI service that integrates well with GitHub, enabling easy setup and configuration of builds and tests in a virtualized environment.

- GitLab CI/CD: Provides an integrated CI/CD solution, available as a self-hosted or cloud-based service. It offers built-in runners, extensive configuration options, and seamless GitLab integration.

## Self-hosted vs. cloud-based environment

When deciding between a self-hosted and cloud-based CI environment, several factors should be considered:

- Cost: Self-hosting requires infrastructure maintenance, while cloud-based services handle provisioning and maintenance, potentially offering cost-effectiveness.

- Scalability: Cloud-based platforms often provide scalable resources for multiple builds and parallel testing. Self-hosted solutions may require additional resources and manual configuration.

- Maintenance: Cloud-based services handle updates and maintenance, ensuring the latest features and security patches. Self-hosted setups require regular maintenance and updates.
